# odin-recipes

In this project I am going to apply some basic HTML skills to make a recipes website.
This website will consist of multiple recipes, linking to different pages, and lists.
Though I know a great bit of HTML and CSS I will only be using HTML for the sake of the assignment on The Odin Project.
